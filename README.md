## Installation

[Download the latest build or source](https://github.com/G4M3RL1F3/Majoras-Mask-AP-PopTracker-Pack/releases/latest) and move the file into your packs folder. Alternatively, you can drag it on top of a PopTracker window, which will prompt you if you want to install the pack.

## Autotracking

Currently, the only autotracking method is by connecting to a slot in a Archipelago server. Follow these steps to connect to a server and autotrack your game:
1. Click the `AP` button in the top left of the window; A new window will open.
2. Type the server's host (`archipelago.gg` or `localhost`, will default to `archipelago.gg`), followed by `:`, then the port (represented by five numbers and are unique to the session).
3. Enter the slot name. In other words, the name that was written in the yaml used to generate.
4. If applicable, enter the password.

If successful, the `AP` button will turn green, meaning it is connected to the server. You are good to go!
